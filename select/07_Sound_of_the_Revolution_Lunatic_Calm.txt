Tell tail signs of life behind
Those late night bed sit eyes
Embers of the fires sparking
All around the sky's are darkening, yeah

All I guess is things will haunt you
Running around the blocks he'll stalk you
That's the point of turning back
The crimson sunset turns to black, yeah

This is the sound of the revolution
I can't hear a thing but now I'm
Seeing everything, yeah
Quiet desperation, that late night desolation, yeah

This is the sound of the revolution
It's getting closer, it's getting nearer
This is the sound of the revolution
